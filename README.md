# Students_performance_prediction
A machine learning model to predict if a students eligibility to graduate

Steps

Load and preprocess the dataset: This includes importing necessary libraries, loading the dataset into a pandas dataframe, performing exploratory data analysis to gain insights, checking for missing values, handling categorical variables, scaling numerical features, splitting the dataset into training and test sets, and possibly performing some feature engineering.

Train and evaluate different machine learning models: This involves selecting appropriate models, setting their hyperparameters, training them on the training set, evaluating their performance on the test set using appropriate metrics, and comparing their performance to select the best model.

Fine-tune the selected model: This step involves using grid search or randomized search to optimize the hyperparameters of the selected model to further improve its performance.


There are several business insights that can be pulled from this analysis:

Understanding demographic differences in test scores: The analysis highlights significant differences in test scores based on gender, race/ethnicity, and parental level of education. This insight can be valuable for educational institutions or businesses that work with students to understand the unique challenges and needs of different student populations, and to develop strategies to support students from underrepresented groups.

Identifying factors that impact eligibility for graduation: The analysis found that most students were eligible for graduation based on the criteria used in this study, but there were some differences based on gender and race/ethnicity. Educational institutions or businesses that work with students can use this information to identify areas where additional support may be needed to ensure that all students have the resources and opportunities to graduate on time.

Highlighting the importance of equity in education: The analysis underscores the importance of promoting equity in education and addressing systemic barriers that may prevent certain groups of students from achieving academic success. Businesses and educational institutions that prioritize equity and diversity can attract and retain a more diverse pool of students or employees, and can help to create a more just and inclusive society.

Emphasizing the value of holistic assessment: The analysis also highlights the limitations of relying solely on test scores to evaluate student performance. By incorporating demographic data and other factors, such as eligibility for graduation, into the analysis, we gain a more nuanced understanding of student achievement and the complex factors that contribute to success in the classroom and beyond. Educational institutions and businesses that take a more holistic approach to assessment can better support their students or employees and help them achieve their full potential.
